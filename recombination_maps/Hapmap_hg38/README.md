The 1000 Genomes genetic map is based on the IMPUTE genetic map based on 1000 Genomes Phase 3, on hg19 coordinates. It was converted to hg38 by Po-Ru Loh at the Broad Institute. After a run of liftOver, he post-processed the data to deal with situations in which consecutive map locations became much closer/farther after lifting. The heuristic used is sufficient for statistical phasing but may not be optimal for other analyses. For this reason, and because of its higher resolution, the DeCODE map is therefore recommended for hg38.
